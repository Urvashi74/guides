To start with Turtle, our first step is to import the Turtle module.

  import turtle
  
Next, we create a turtle. Let's create a turtle named, say Alex.

  alex= turtle.Turtle()
  
We have various methods that can be used to control the turtle and draw graphics.
A few of them are :

forward()
backward()
right()
left()
goto()
shape()
color()
speed()

We use these using the turtle we created followed by a dot (.) operator followed by the function name.
Like,

alex.forward(20)
alex.right(10)
alex.speed(10)
alex.shape("circle")

To display the graphics drawn by the turtle we need a window to display it on. For that we use :

window=turtle.Screen()

We can set the background color of the window using :

window.bgcolor("black")

You can then save the file with a .py extension and run it.
